# Cyber Lab Notes 🛡️🔍

Welcome to my cybersecurity learning diary!  
I'm Adedotun, aspiring SOC Analyst from Lagos, NG 🇳🇬.  
Here I'll collect hands-on notes, commands, screenshots, and takeaways from free labs like TryHackMe, as I build blue-team skills.

Goal: Learn threat detection, log analysis, networking basics, and incident response to block more attacks.

Currently:  
- Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate (in progress)  
- Planning my first TryHackMe rooms

## Quick Learning Plan (Next 2–4 Weeks)
1. Start with free beginner rooms on TryHackMe (no premium needed)  
2. Write notes here for each one  
3. Move to simple Python scripts later

## First Rooms I'll Do (All Free & Beginner-Friendly)
- **Junior Security Analyst Intro** → A day in the life of a junior analyst  
  Link: https://tryhackme.com/room/jrsecanalystintrouxo  
- **SOC Role in Blue Team** → What SOC does, tiers, daily tasks  
  Link: https://tryhackme.com/room/socroleinblueteam  
- **Introductory Networking** or **What is Networking?** → Basics of how networks work  
- **Pre Security** path intro rooms (free path) → Good foundation  
- **Blue** room → Classic for understanding common attacks from defender view

More coming soon — first write-up dropping after I finish one!
