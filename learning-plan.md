# My Cybersecurity Learning Plan – Beginner SOC Analyst

## Current Status (Feb 2026)
- Zero rooms completed yet (fresh start!)
- Grinding Google Cybersecurity Certificate
- Tools: Just browser + TryHackMe account for now

## 30-Day Goals
- Complete 4–7 free TryHackMe rooms  
- Write detailed notes + screenshots for each in this repo  
- Understand basic concepts: Blue team vs Red team, SOC tiers, common attacks  
- Start installing VirtualBox/VMware for future labs (if needed)

## Free TryHackMe Starting Rooms (Prioritized)
1. Junior Security Analyst Intro<a href="https://tryhackme.com/room/jrsecanalystintrouxo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"></a> – Play a day as analyst  
2. SOC Role in Blue Team<a href="https://tryhackme.com/room/socroleinblueteam" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"></a> – SOC basics  
3. Introductory Networking / What is Networking? (search on THM)  
4. Intro to LAN or Network Fundamentals  
5. Blue (when ready – shows Windows attacks/defense)  

Track: I'll add a new .md file here after each room, e.g., jr-analyst-intro.md
